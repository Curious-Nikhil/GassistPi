# ABSTRACT
Computers have fueled our growth for the last century rapidly. They can solve complex problems in a matter of seconds. Yet, it’s very difficult for them to understand human speech. Things that are inherently easy for humans, is unfortunately really hard for computers.  Fortunately for us, for the first time ever, due to rapid advancements in machine learning and processing power, it is possible for computers to understand human speech, talk and analyse images.
Google Assistant has utilized a decade of text-to-speech research from Google and has open sourced it. This will enhance the human ability for decades to come.  Now, it’s possible to Embed the Google Assistant in any device.

# INTRODUCTION
Engineers with business methodologies are the greatest support to our society. The advancements in technologies drive their thoughts and speculates to achieve various goals in fields of science. Arduino has been used as a platform to work for a long time. But with the dispatch of Raspberry pi, a credit card size low-price affordable computer, Arduino is no longer used in application platform. Raspberry pi platform is being used widely from the past few years as it provides easy use support and documentation. It is readily available to all the end users. From simple educational to smart application projects, Raspberry Pi has proved its significance in the development of applications spreading out in various fields. Raspberry Pi equipped with a int

The client side send a audio file via internet to Google’s Server for complex analysis of the speech and it’s properties using Deep Neural Networks which have been thoroughly trained, hence have a positive result most of the time.

# Implementation


It uses the power of Google Cloud Platform and it’s decade long research in speech - recognition to make it possible to implement voice enabled devices with ease.
Google Cloud Platform receives audio input from the Personal Assistant and uses Deep Neural Network to convert speech into text. Only then it is able to search for the answer. After finding the desired result, from Google’s Knowledge Graph, It starts to synthesize speech from text. Text-to-speech uses deep neural networks (AI) to synthesize a voice output. This is then sent via the internet to the personal assistant to give out the answer. All of this happens in seconds, due to today's nature of internet speed and cloud computer’s increasing efficiency.
